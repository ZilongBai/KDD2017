# KDD2017 Unsupervised Network Discovery for Brain Imaging Data
This repository contains matlab source code to solve the Orthogonal Nonnegative Matrix tri-Factorization with Spatial Continuity Regularization to learn a complete simplified network with both Nodes and Edges from the corrlation graph of fMRI scan without strong supervision. That is, discover clusters of voxels as Nodes and the inter-/intra-cluster correlations as Edges. Each learnt cluster is spatially continuous. 

The details of the model and the solver are described in our paper
[Unsupervised Network Discovery for Brain Imaging Data](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3098023&CFID=796408940&CFTOKEN=92880021), which demonstrates their utility in the analyses of both synthetic networks constructed with anatomical properties and real-world brain scans. 
The deduction of solving Unsupervised Node Discovery subproblem involves techniques similar to Orthogonal Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (Ding et al. 2006). The details of deductions can also be found in our paper.
